Iâ€™m Yashvi, a CSE student passionate about building tech thatâ€™s smart, simple, and impactful.

I love bringing ideas to life through code â€” from clean UIs to backend systems using Spring Boot, Java, cloud computing, and Python. 
Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring AI and doing lots of DSA (with lots of late-night debugging along the way!).

Outside of tech, youâ€™ll find me sketching, watching K-Drama, or playing Stumble Guys like a pro.

**Fun Facts:**
- Iâ€™m most productive when the worldâ€™s asleep ðŸŒ™
- I drink coffee like my life is dependant on it.
- Studio Ghibli movies have my heart, especially Ponyo.
