  Hello there!  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9cf602f-9d39-4b74-a3a2-4997e940d36c" width="20"/>

Iâ€™m **[Yashvi Sharma](https://yashvisharma1204.github.io/yashvi/)**, a CSE student passionate about building tech thatâ€™s smart, simple, and impactful.

I love bringing ideas to life through code â€” from clean UIs to backend systems using `Spring Boot`, `Java`, `cloud computing`, and `Python`. 
Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring `data science` and doing lots of `DSA` (with lots of late-night debugging along the way!).

Outside of tech, youâ€™ll find me sketching, watching K-Drama, or playing Stumble Guys like a pro.

**Fun Facts:**
- Iâ€™m most productive when the worldâ€™s asleep ðŸŒ™
- I drink coffee like my life is dependant on it.
- Studio Ghibli movies have my heart, especially Ponyo.
