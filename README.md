I’m **Yashvi Sharma**, a Computer Science student focused on building systems that are intelligent, scalable, and meaningful.

Right now, I’m deeply engaged in **Data Structures & Algorithms** and **Machine Learning**, with a growing interest in **ML research** and real-world problem solving. I enjoy working across the stack, from clean interfaces to robust backend systems, and I’m actively **seeking SDE internship opportunities**.

My technical toolkit includes

Outside of code, I’m usually running on **coffee**, reading books, or listening to music that completely depends on my mood. I believe confidence is a habit, so I dress well to feel good, and I make sure I sleep peacefully to stay stress-free and focused.

**Fun Facts**
- Most of my deep work happens late at night 🌙  
- Coffee is non-negotiable  
- Books help me slow down and think clearly  
- My music taste changes with my emotions  
- Dressing well boosts my confidence, good sleep keeps me balanced
